# IAT-Hooker-x64

IAT Hooker is a tool that I recently developed to hook any function within the Import Address Table (IAT). It serves as a universal hooker designed for hooking x64 PE files with a custom DLL injector. IAT Hooking (T0874) is categorized as a Privilege Escalation and Execution tactic, as listed in the MITRE Enterprise framework
